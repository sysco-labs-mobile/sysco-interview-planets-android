# Sysco LABS Android Interview Challenge - Star Wars API
## sysco-interview-planets-android

_A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..._

### Objectives

* Using the Star Wars API [https://swapi.dev/](https://swapi.dev/), make a request to get all planets. You can find the API documentation [here](https://swapi.dev/documentation).
* Display planets in a scrollable list with Planet Name (`name`) and Climate (`climate`).
* Open a planet details pane when clicking on a planet in the list. On this page display the Planet Name (`name`), Orbital Period (`orbital_period`), and Gravity (`gravity`).
* _Optional if time permitting:_ Add icons for the planets on the cards using [http://picsum.photos](http://picsum.photos) for sample images

### Guidelines

* Use any first or third party libraries that you want - some popular library dependencies have been provided in the gradle file in this repo but feel free to add any additional libraries you need.
* Talk us through your thought process, design decisions, etc. - getting the correct solution is only part of what we are looking for so let us know what decisions you are making and why.
* Feel free to ask us for any clarifications if something is unclear or ambiguous.

_Good luck and may the force be with you!_
